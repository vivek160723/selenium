####Customized Locators:###

1.css locators: Generally we dont use css selector
-Tag and id:use (#) in between
-Tag and class:use (.) in between
-Tag and Attribute: use ([]) and (=) in between
-Tag,class and Attribute

2.Xpath: is is basically the address of the element/it ia defined as XML path(//tagname[@attribute='value'])
-two types absolute(full xpath) and relative=//input[name="e-mail]
- it is used to find the position of any element through html dome structure
? Difference between absolute and relative XPATH
we use prefer to relative xpath  bcz change in the positi on of the element the relative path remain same
